SoGtk is a GTK+ toolkit library for using Open Inventor with GTK+.  It
has been developed as a replacement library for InventorXt for GTK+ users.
SoGtk should work equally well on top of Coin (SIM's Open Inventor clone),
SGI Open Inventor, and TGS Open Inventor.

To build SoGtk, you need the following libraries:

  - [GTK+](https://www.gtk.org/) (glib + gtk).
  - An Open Inventor implementation.

Although you can contact the author directly, please use the coin3d-discuss
mailing list for SoGtk-related questions.  Information on the coin mailing
lists can be found on the support page at [www.coin3d.org](https://www.coin3d.org/).
To browse previous discussions on coin3d-discuss (to see if the subject has
already been discussed), look up the coin3d-discuss mailing list at

To generate the SoGtk API documentation yourself, you need the Doxygen
utility.  The documentation is also available online at the Coin web site,
at [SoGtk](https://www.coin3d.org/SoGtk/html/).
