SoGtk is a library with GUI components for Open Inventor using GTK+,
developed for Coin, SIM's Open Inventor implementation.  You will find
Coin where you found SoGtk, at <URL:http://www.coin3d.org/coin.html>.

To build SoGtk, you need the following libraries:

  - GTK+ <URL:http://www.gtk.org/>.
  - The GtkGLArea widget <URL:http://www.student.oulu.fi/~jlof/gtkglarea/>.
  - An Open Inventor library (e.g. Coin).

The current state of affairs is that the SoGtk component hierarchy is
developed down to (and only to) the SoGtkRenderArea component at this
point in time - to be picked up again at a later date.  With the
SoGtkRenderArea implemented, GTK+ users will be able to start using Coin
with GTK+ (in the Open Inventor way), and if needed implement the viewers
they need themselves by looking at the implementation of the SoQt and
SoBe libraries.  Those libraries will have a higher priority than SoGtk
until they are completed.

Although you can contact the author directly, please use the coin-discuss
mailing-list for SoGtk-related questions.  Information on the coin mailing-
lists can be found on the support page at http://www.coin3d.org/coin.html
