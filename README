SoGtk is a GTK+ toolkit library for using Open Inventor with GTK+.  It
was developed as a replacement library for InventorXt for GTK+ users.
SoGtk can be used on top of Coin (SIM's Open Inventor clone), SGI's Open
Inventor, and TGS' Open Inventor.

To build SoGtk, you need the following libraries:

  - GTK+ <URL:http://www.gtk.org/>.
  - The GtkGLArea widget <URL:http://www.student.oulu.fi/~jlof/gtkglarea/>.
  - An Open Inventor library.

Although you can contact the author directly, please use the coin-discuss
mailing-list for SoGtk-related questions.  Information on the coin mailing-
lists can be found on the support page at <URL:http://www.coin3d.org/>.
