TODO
====

* [larsa:20000201] clean up all the Qt-related comments in the source code.

* [larsa:20000201] make GtkMiscClass the parent class of GtkThumbwheel instead
    of plain GtkWidget (for the added padding and alignment functionality).

* [larsa:20000201] change #ifndef/#define/#endif header-wrapper namespace.

* [larsa:20000117] consider implementing our own GL widget for GTK+ to avoid
    the somewhat inconvenient extra library dependency for GtkGLArea.  may
    need to do something like this for GTK+ for Windows and BeOS anyways,
    since the SoGtkGLArea widget seems to be in development doze-mode.
