If you want to work _with_ the SoGtk sourcecode (not just writing
applications _using_ the SoGtk library) -- for helping us fixing bugs,
improve performance, or whatever reasons -- this file contains some
hints and tips for you.

1 The Bleeding Edge
===================

First of all, you should make sure you are building from the latest
sources from the CVS branch you want to work with. This is done by
using the Concurrent Versioning System for staying in sync with the
sourcecode repository we at Systems in Motion are using.  Follow the
instructions on the webpages at <URL:http://www.coin3d.org>.

If you are not familiar with CVS, check out the CVS homepages at
<URL:http://cvshome.org/>.


XXX FIXME: complete doc. XXX

* Building SoGtk for development (UNIX)
	- discuss common C++ large project problems
	- solutions applied in SoGtk
		o using multiply configure'd build directories
			- slim
			- full debug
                        - with profiling
                        - different platforms
		o --enable-hacking (gives quick turn-around time)
		o symlinks from install directory to avoid ``make install''
		o ``make install'' from src/Inventor/Gtk instead of root
                o make install-data
                o make *-am
		o explain mechanisms for overloading methods in
                  dynamic libraries

* Differences, MSWin

* Build hacking, autogen.sh/Autoconf/Automake/Libtool

* Styleguide for code
	- rip out the text from Metadon.conf

* Submitting patches
	- technical walk-through
	- legal aspects

* come work for us
        - interest in 3D visualization
        - C++ expertise a definitive plus
